# The Production

The drama room had started to fill with the actors, some were practicing lines or trying to improve on small things, the stage hands were trying to fine tune certain elements.  There were a lot of people running back and forth from the drama room to the auditorium.

Conner sat with Brian listening to him talk about dog accessories, he was still wearing the Toto makeup from the previous performance to the student body.  “So you see the Martingale collar is better for bigger dogs, it wouldn’t even make sense for a small dog like Toto to have one.” Brian explained to him.

“You should definitely tell Trish that, I’m sure she would want to hear all about it.” Conner told him “I am an actor and I wear what I am told.”

“Yeah I can see that.” Brian teased Conner while patting his head, Conner just rolled his puppy dog eyes at him.

Jessica had walked up to them, she was already wearing her Dorothy dress. “Toto, it’s almost time to get ready, we don’t want to be late.”

“Come on Brian, you can check out the rest of the outfit.” Conner told him, the three of them headed to the stage. He led Brian up the stairs and grabbed the costume bag off the rack and motioned for Brian to join him in the dressing room.  He handed Brian the bag while he started to take off his clothes, he had seen him change on a few occasions and he wasn’t embarrassed about Brian seeing him.  Brian pulled the costume out and inspected it, he ran his hand over the fake fur.  

Conner now in just his briefs sat on his feet.  “So you need to help pull it up to my knees and legs.” He instructed.

Brian unzipped the outfit and pulled it up Conner’s legs until it was at his feet.  “There should be a pocket my feet go in, just help me get them in.” Conner instructed.  Brian grabbed his foot and guided it into the pocket, then the second, Conner giggled as he did it.  Playfully Brian purposely tickled his feet a little causing waves of giggles from Conner.

“You’re really ticklish\!” Brian said with glee.

“Stop\! This is serious.” Conner laughed.

Brian stopped and helped Conner pull up the arms and zipped up the back.  Conner adjusted and then moved to a walking position.  “Thanks Brian, I think it’s just the collar left.”

Brian took the collar and put it over Conner’s head, he pulled it so it was against his neck and then the two stepped out to allow the next person to use the room.  Brian ran his hand down Conner’s back.  “It’s such a nice outfit. You really do look like Toto.” Brian praised him. “But something isn’t right, wait here I want to grab something.”

Conner moved to the side to not be in anyone’s way and waited for his friend, he wasn't sure what he was doing, after a minute he came rushing back.  He knelt down in front of him and pulled out a hair brush.  “I borrowed this from the makeup area, the fur in this costume looks too messy, it should be brushed.” Brian told him.

“If you think it will look better.” Conner said, confused.

Brian spent a few minutes running the brush down his back, sides and legs.  Then a few moments blending the hair from his neck to the costume. “I think that looks cleaner\!” He smiled at Conner.

Billy had walked up to them watching this happen. “Well if it isn’t the boy and his dog\!” He teased them.  “You just like to be a pampered puppy, don’t you Toto?”

Conner just looked away from him embarrassed that he caught Brian doting over him.  “It’s not like that Billy, it’s for the show.” Conner said humbly.

Billy grinned at them. “I know you like it, I’m sure your friend here loves playing with his new puppy,” Billy continued.

Brian stood up and looked at Billy “You are an ass, why don’t you leave us alone.” Brian demanded.

Billy’s eyes narrowed at Brian. “What did you call me?” he questioned him.

“I called you an ass, no wonder Harvey dumped you\!” Brian antagonized him.

Billy’s face reddened and got clearly flustered. “Harvey and I are still together, what the hell do you know, you twerp.” Billy stammered.  He then gave him a shove and walked off.

Conner looked up at Brian.  “Thanks Brian.”

“No problem Toto, I hate bullies.” Brian smiled at him, he spent a few more moments cleaning up and fussing over Conner’s outfit. “Do you get to keep it?”

“The costume? No, it belongs to the school.” Conner told him.

“That’s too bad.” Brian said disappointed, blushing a little. “I have to go now and you're starting in a few minutes, so break a leg\!”  Brian then walked away leaving Conner to meet up with Jessica on the stage.

Conner and Jessica were in the middle of the stage for the second time today, they waited in the dark while Ms Gray addressed the audience, thanked them for purchasing tickets and helping support the drama club.  The curtains slowly opened revealing the audience.  The floor mats and benches had been replaced with more chairs for the audience, unlike earlier there wasn’t any order to the audience, most sat together in families.  Conner quickly scanned the audience until his eyes landed on his mother and father.  His mother looked really excited and waved at them while his father had his mouth covered by his hand trying to hide a laugh.

Conner and Jessica performed the scene without any issue.  As the play progresses Conner plays the role of Toto perfectly, he isn’t nervous or embarrassed at all.  The audience laughs when he expects them to and he is able to pull off a convincing performance.  The play got to the scene with Billy, the flying monkey, attacking the group and kidnapping them.  Billy came out on set, he looked more fierce than any of the previous performances.  Dorothy and the Lion play their parts and start running away, Toto tries to slow the monkey down by barking at him.

“ARF\! ARF\! ARF\!” Conner cried out.

“Out of the way doggy\!” Billy said with his practiced lines, a lot more malice in his voice.

As the flying monkey chased the actors off the stage, Toto followed behind them. The group had to rush around to the other side of the stage while Rayna took their place.  Billy stormed out ahead of them, not wanting to chat.

As the curtains close over the final scene, there is a level of ease and relief that fills Conner.  He did it, he was able to play a main role in a production, albeit not a traditionally speaking role.  The curtain opened once more and the cast had gathered to take a bow, thunderous applause from the audience was heard.

After the play, before they headed backstage Conner and Jessica’s parents came up.  Other students were also meeting their parents as well, taking pictures and exchanging gifts.

“Congratulations\! You two, I’m so proud\!” Linda congratulated her children.  “You two look great in your costumes, I got a lot of pictures\!”

“Thanks Mom.” Conner said, sitting on the stage.

“Well done, both of you.  Conner you played an interesting role.” Conner’s father, David, congratulated him.

“Thanks Dad.” Conner said smiling.

Jessica saw Sara waving at her. “Oh, Mom, Dad. I got invited to an after party with the other students at Sara’s.” She told them.

“Oh, that’s nice, will Sara’s parent’s be there?” Linda asked.

“Well, maybe, I didn’t ask.  But Toto was also invited, so it’s for the whole cast\!” Jessica said, changing the subject.

Linda and David exchanged looks.  “Well if you promise to look out for Conner, I suppose you two can go to the party.” David told them.

“Thank you, I will look out for Conner, don’t worry\!” Jessica said. 

“Before you head off with your friends let’s get a picture\!” Linda told them and took a selfie with the four of them in view, Conner was in the center with Jessica kneeling down above him.

“Let’s meet up with Sara and head over.” Jessica clearly excited and motioned Conner to follow her.

“I’ll see you later then, I’m going to the party\!” Conner told his parents and followed after Jessica.

Sara was gathering people around explaining the plan. “Okay, the party is at my place, it’s right beside the school so we can go straight there.” People were nodding, others already knew where Sara’s house was. “I also thought it would be fun if we made it a costume party\! I already asked Mrs Bell and she said we could borrow them.”

Conner was going to ask to change since he couldn’t stand up in his outfit. “Um, Sara.” Conner tried to get her attention.

Instead of Sara, Jessica knelt down. “What is it, Toto?” She asked.

“I wanted to change before the party, this outfit will be annoying.” Conner explained to his sister.

Jessica smiled. “You want to be the only one at the party not wearing a costume? Don’t you want to fit in with the rest of the cast?” She asked.

Conner was conflicted, he had never been to an older kids party and didn’t know what to expect. “Yeah, I suppose so.” He told her quietly.

“Then it’s settled.” Jessica whispered to Conner then stoody back up.

One of the munchkins ran up to Sara after the performance. She was wearing a red dress with yellow dots. “Sara, we did it\! The play is over\!” She cried.

“Congratulations Emily\! We did it\!” Sara said to her as they hugged.

“Everyone, this is our co-star, Emily, my little sister.” Sara told everyone.

Conner followed the group as they made their way through the school. There were plenty of people who stopped and praised them on their performance as they walked. Everyone stood around taking pictures with the cast, Conner was a crowd favorite and kids kept wanting to take pictures with him. He felt a little embarrassed and proud at the same time, it was a mix of emotions for Conner.  He looked at the cast and saw Billy and Harvey chatting, they seemed to be getting into a heated argument, occasionally Harvey or Billy would glance at him.  Jessica noticed and knelt down beside Conner. “You didn’t tell Billy anything, did you?” She whispered.

“Brian brought it up before the play.” He whispered back to his sister.

Jessica inhaled deeply and sighed. “Well it was going to come out tonight one way or another, so don’t worry too much about it.” Jessica told him.  Conner thought he was getting off easy with his friend revealing her secret.

Conner followed the cast as they made their way through the school. He felt awkward about having to run on his hands and knees after his classmates, but they stopped and waited for him to catch up.
