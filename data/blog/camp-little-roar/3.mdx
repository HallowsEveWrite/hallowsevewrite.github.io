Luke opened the door to cabin three and marched inside, the four boys followed him.  He went searching around the cabin until he found what he was looking for.  Luke went to the table and placed the tattoo markers on the table.  “I think we need both canoes to have someone representing the tiger team spirit.” Luke said with a grin.  “Let’s get Phil to draw a tiger face on Greg, then everyone will know we are a united team even if we are in separate boats.”

“Great idea Luke\! Let’s make him a White Tiger since we already have an orange one.” Alex suggested.

“Whoa, whoa, don’t I get a say in this\!” Greg sounded nervous.

“Oh would you prefer a standard tiger then?” Alex asked with a grin.

“I don’t want to have my face painted, don’t those last all summer?” Greg sounded worried.

“Well, I got my whole body painted for the team to win. It’s just your face.” Luke laid on the guilt as he was already dressed as a cute tiger.  Phil had started to collect the colors he needed from the box.

Defeated, Greg just sat down in front of Phil.  “The white tiger is fine, just don’t do my whole head like Luke’s.”

“Sure Greg.” Phil said as he started to get to work.  Phil drew a white base that stopped at his forehead and chin, he then drew small details like the nose and eyes.  The last step was to create the stripes and whiskers.  In only a few minutes the tiger face was applied to his face.  Unlike Luke's, Greg's face looked like something a kid would get painted for a circus.  
“You look great Greg, I think the tiger cabin is sure to win the competition now.” Alex said.  “Let’s head over to the beach and pick out the canoe.”

Greg tried to pull his hat down so no one could see his face, it didn’t work very well.  Eventually the five of them made it to the beach where the race was going to start.  The Owl team had also made their way to the beach and Zack had changed into his full costume for the event.

Marcus was there waiting for the group to arrive, he asked the leaders to step up and did a coin toss.  The Owl cabin won and got to select the canoes first, they picked the newest and lightest looking canoes on the beach.  Alex then inspected many others and selected two light looking canoes but not quite as new.

“I see Cabin Three has decided they need a second mascot\!” Zack shouted at them.

“It’s up to our mascot to figure out team spirit, so we agreed with him.  Greg isn’t our mascot, he is just representing the team on the second canoe.”  Alex explained, clearly protecting himself from the rules.  Greg looked embarrassed and Luke looked proud of himself.

“Alright kids, once the other cabins arrive the race will start.  This is the main activity for the day so once we are done you have some free time.” Marcus explained to them.

Slowly the other cabins made their way to the beach and selected their canoes.  Marcus came around to each of the groups and handed out life jackets, paddles, whistles and balers.  The boats were lined up on the beach with all the cabins standing in front of them.

“Hello campers, I have heard that there is someone here who is very competitive.  Before we jump into the boats I wanted to take a moment to review the current scores.  Tied for first place we have the Owl and Tiger cabin, both at five points.  Next is Lion with four points, monkey with three points, moose with two points, elephant with one.  The winner of this race will be awarded six points counting down from there.  Teams need to make it to the opposite beach, pick up the Camp Little Roar flags from Erica and the first team to return with five flags wins.” Marcus moved to the centre of the beach and held out a blow horn. “On your marks, get set, go” Marcus blared the horn.

The kids all started pushing their boats into the water, Simon and Luke jumped in while Alex pushed them into the lake.  Phil and Greg had already gotten into the water. Luke waved at Greg until he got their attention.  “Remember Greg, show some team spirit\! ROAR\!” Luke shouted at Greg.

Luke waited and eventually heard a meek “roar.” from Greg.  Satisfied Luke focused on paddling his own canoe. The three of them paddled as hard as they could, working up quite a sweat.  Looking around they weren’t in last place as they reached the opposite beach where Erica had been stationed with the flags.  Ahead of them were the owl cabin who were just getting back in their canoe.

“Hurry up guys, Alex and the tiger are right on our tail.” Zack said as he pushed his canoe off the beach.

Alex hit the beach, jumped out and pulled the boat up onto the beach.  Luke and Simon jumped out, the three of them ran up to Erica for a flag.  She greeted them, handing Alex five flags.  “You need to wait until everyone in your cabin makes it to the beach before continuing.” Erica explained.  The three of them went back to the boat and positioned it ready to go.  Eventually a couple other groups were also waiting when Phil and Greg arrived.

Greg was exhausted and trying to catch his breath, Alex ran up and helped with the boat.  “Phil, I have an idea to still win this.” Alex said.

“Oh, how could we, Owl is already on the way back.” Phil asked, looking back at Greg. “Plus he is going to need a minute.”

“That’s fine, we are going to switch canoes.  Phil and Luke will switch boats, Phil you’re stronger and we don’t need all the cabin members to win, just all the flags.” Alex explained.  “We only needed everyone here to leave.”

Phil smiled. “Alright let’s go now, Greg make sure Luke gets back safely.”  In a flash the three of them took off at full speed.

“So much for needing a mascot in the boat.” Greg grumbled.

“Hopefully we still win spirit points though.” Luke said.

“That’s all you’re worried about, eh? You are so bought into your brother’s plan you don’t even see him using you to get to Zack?” Greg was getting more serious.

“Look, we better start heading back.”  Luke and Greg both had their faces painted like tigers, put the second boat in the water and left the shore.  This time Luke was in the front of the boat and it was considerably harder.

As they were paddling Greg complained some more. “I just don’t get why you had to get my face tattooed too.  I look like a dweeb.”

“It’s not as bad as me though, I may as well be a tiger at this point.” Luke was getting annoyed with Greg, why should he be the only one embarrassed about dressing like a tiger all summer.”

“Yeah, that’s true.  Atleast I’m not stuck in some stupid tiger getup.” Greg laughed at Luke.  “It’s still better than what Alex had to wear though.”

“What are you talking about?” Luke asked.

“Well last year Alex was the mascot.” Greg said.

“I didn’t know that, what was he wearing?” Luke asked, slowing his paddling down.

“Keep up the pace, I don’t want to be on the lake all day\!” Greg said. “He was wearing a full getup and our leader made him wear it all the time as well.  It was like footie pajamas with built-in mittens and a large mascot head, he only wore shoes when we actually went hiking and even then it was over his outfit.”  Greg giggled to himself reminiscing about last year. “So at least he was nice enough to make yours shorts and short sleeves, the tattoo markers are probably too much though.”

Luke started paddling harder and thought about Alex wearing a baby outfit all summer and not being allowed to change.

“Well what if we get everyone to wear something tiger related?” Luke suggested. “Then we will win for sure and we won’t be the only ‘dweebs’”

“Yeah let’s do it\! We can plan it out this afternoon\!” Greg said.

The two paddled as hard as they could and finally made it to shore.
