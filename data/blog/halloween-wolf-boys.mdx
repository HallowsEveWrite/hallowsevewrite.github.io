It is a few days before Halloween and Cameron hasn’t planned anything yet, typically he and his older brother, Eric, would go out together however Eric mentioned he had other plans this year, since turning thirteen.  Cameron is playing in his room when Eric and his best friend Jace come in.  “Hey Cam, what are your plans for Halloween?”

Cameron looks at Eric and Jace, they both have an unsettling smile on their face. “I haven’t made any plans, why do you care?”

“Well I know I told you that I had plans and couldn’t take you trick or treating, but Mom and Dad are going to be out of town and said I had to watch you.  The thing is we were going to have a party and were wondering if you wanted to come?”

Cameron looked at his brother thinking he was up to something. “I don’t know, I still want to go trick or treating, it sounds like Mom and Dad said you needed to take me.”

Eric smiled wide.  “Oh we can still take you trick or treating, we are even taking Jace’s younger brother.  Then we will all go to the party\!”

Cameron seemed fine with that answer.  “Okay I’ll go with you, but I haven’t picked my costume out yet.”

“Oh don’t worry about that, we are going as a group.  You, me, Jace and his brother\!”

“Oh what are we going to do?” Cameron asked getting a little excited

“It’s a surprise, we will get ready at Jace’s house before we go trick or treating, then straight to the party.”

“Cool okay, sounds fun\!”

It’s Halloween and Cameron and Eric head over to Jace’s.  “Okay Cam, a couple ground rules.  One, no complaining, this is going to be a fun night and two, when Jace or I aren’t with you his brother Eli is in charge since he’s older.  Also just so you know we are staying the night and you are staying in Eli’s room.”

“Oh I see, this is how you get out of watching both me and Eli, now I see why you wanted me to come.”

Eric just winks at his little brother, “Now you get it.  I don’t think you two will get into much trouble anyway.”

Cameron and Eric make it to Jace and Eli’s, just a few blocks over.  Cameron knocks on the door and is let in by Jace.  “Hey, perfect timing Trish just finished up with my costume\!”.  Cameron was dressed as a great looking werewolf, complete with makeup, ears and torn clothes.  He had great looking werewolf makeup and a furry hood.

“You look great man, can’t wait to get started.” Eric walked in.

“Who is Trish” Cameron asked.

“She is from the school theater group, she agreed to help us out tonight in exchange for a favour.” Jace answered.

Jace led Cameron and Eric to his room where Trish had a few clothes bags and makeup kits.

“Hello boys, Eric I take it you’re next then we will do Cameron and Eli together”

“Oh why are we together?” Cameron was curious.

“Your makeup is the same colour so it will be easier this way.  But Eric here will take about thirty minutes so why don’t you play with Eli while we finish him up?”

“Sure, I’ll be back soon.” 

Cameron walks down to Eli’s room and opens the door. “Hello, my name is Cameron, Eric’s brother”

“Oh hi Cameron, I’m Eli.  I see we are going trick or treating together this year\!” Eli was smiling.

“Yeah, apparently as werewolves\! It’s going to be awesome\!  Then we are going to a party\!”

“Yeah, it’s going to be great they even have someone doing our costumes and makeup\!”

The two decided to just chat about movies and comics for a bit until they were called down for costumes.  Jace eventually came to the room and opened the door, still dressed as a werewolf.  “Hey guys it's your turn\!  Just leave your clothes here in Eli’s room since this is where you’re spending the night.”

Eli complied and pulled off his clothes leaving in just his underwear.  Cameron, feeling a little uneasy, slowly pulled off his shirt and pants leaving them on Eli’s floor. Cameron was taking too long so Eli grabbed his hand and pulled him towards his brother’s room.  Once Cameron was in Jace’s room he felt embarrassed with everyone staring at him in his underwear.  “Hey kids, grab a seat.”.  Trish motioned to the two chairs on the ground.  Eli pulled Cameron to the chairs and they both sat down, Cameron’s face was red from blushing.  
Cameron looked around the room and saw his brother in a fierce looking werewolf costume, a little different than Jace’s, darker fur and no shirt.  Eric’s upper body was all wolf, he had grey fur and he was wearing makeup to match.  He was wearing torn jeans and he could see fur coming through the rips.  Cameron thought it was super cool, “You look great Eric\!”

“Oh you think, Trish is great at costumes\!  I’ll leave you to her as you clearly don’t want an audience, you may as well be a tomato”  Cameron’s face was still flushing from sitting in only his underwear.  Eric then left the room.

“Okay boys makeup first, then we will put on the costumes”  She pulled out a few brushes and started applying the makeup.  “Close your eyes as this will take some time.”  Cameron complied and closed his eyes.  He felt her apply makeup all over his face and neck, she even painted his ears and back of his head.  Cameron had long brown hair and she held it out of the way while she painted.  “Okay Cameron sit tight while I work on Eli”.  Trish proceeded to do a similar paint job on Eli.

Trish started rummaging through one of her bags and pulled out a few face prosthetics.  “Cameron, let's get you started first.”  She pulled out some glue and applied a fake nose to Cameron’s face. It was cold at first but then he barely even noticed it.  As the nose dried Trish also did the same to Eli and then she painted both of them.  Cameron’s and Eli’s face were fully painted.  He now understood why she did both of them together, Eli had the same hair color as him and the facepaint was a perfect match, he and Eli both had hair down to their neck.

 “Okay something fun just for you two, but you need to behave.” Trish pulled out some fake fangs, one for each of them.  “Now these are like dentures, not like the plastic ones at the store so you need to keep your mouths closed while it sets up.”

“No problem, Cameron and I got this”  Eli winked at Cameron.

Trish applied what looked like some type of toothpaste to the fake teeth,  “Okay Cameron open wide, bite down and hold it there for about 5 minutes, I’ll tell you when it’s done”  Cameron opened his mouth and Trish placed the teeth over his teeth and he bit down.  The sensation was odd, it felt like his mouth was full and was being held slightly open, he could feel the paste full cover his teeth.  There was no mirror in the room so he looked at Eli.  Trish did the same to another pair of teeth and placed them in Eli’s mouth, he saw that some of the fangs were visible which explained the odd feeling in his mouth.

“Okay, the hard part is over and we are almost ready for trick or treating, just hold that in your mouth a little longer.”  Trish stated as she pulled out four brown pointed ears from her bag, she started with Eli and wrapped his hair tightly around the clip and placed it on his head, the affect was that they looked like his ears, then the same to Cameron.  Cameron looked at Eli and his head really did look like an animal head with fangs, nose, painted face and animal ears.

“Great job boys\!  I haven’t worked with kids this young in a while and I have to say you're less fussy than your brothers, let’s get you into costumes now”  Cameron was glad to finally put on some clothes and not be sitting in his underwear.  “Just keep those teeth closed so your fangs fit\!”

Cameron kept his mouth tightly shut and grabbed Trish's hand as she helped the two of them up.  Trish pulled some dark fabric out of a clothes bag, two sheets of brown fabric and dropped them in front of them.  Trish then arranged each piece and unzipped a zipper and pulled open a suit.  She then took it a step further and arranged it so the legs were pulled inside out.  “Okay, these are special suits that have built in shoes, I’ll guide your feet in.”  

Trish picked up Cameron's leg and placed his foot into what felt like a slipper, he could feel the sole underneath but the costume itself was hard to make out as it was mostly inside out.  Trish then placed his other foot into the other slipper.  Trish did the same to Eli.  

“Okay Cameron, last step, please put your arms in the sleeves.”  Cameron complied and the rest happened much faster than he expected, as Trish zipped up the back of the costume and pulled the arms into position.  Like the feet the hands, or paws, were attached to the rest of the costume and his hands filled them.  The suit has a high neck and came up to his chin with a high collar, the zipper zipped all the way up.  As Trish then worked on Eli’s suit Cameron inspected the suit.  The paws were oversized and very plush, Cameron could barely move the paws with his hands since they were so over sized.  He looked down at his feet and saw they were also made to look like oversized paws.

Trish stepped back admiring her work and announced “All right, you two look great and ready to go trick or treating, just one final touch.”  She stepped behind them and attached something to his neck, she did the same to Eli.

 “Jace, Eric your brothers are ready\!”  Trish looked at the two who looked confused about the costumes.  “You can open your mouth now, the fangs should be set”

Cameron tried to ask a question about the paws of the costume and realized the fangs got in the way of his mouth and tongue.  “Hoouw oo aye oove aye ans”.  Cameron got embarrassed at what he just said, it sounded nothing like “How do I move my hands”.  He was getting worried and reached up to his mouth, he couldn’t do anything with the paws in the way.  He then tried to move the fangs with his tongue but they wouldn’t budge.  He looked over at Eli who also tried to speak.

“Whas oing on, we were twicked\!” Eli was clearly getting flustered.  Cameron finally took notice of Eli’s complete look.  Head to toe he was covered in brown, his face was painted to match his hair which matched his suit.  He had fluffy ears and a fluffy tail and oversized paws for hands and feet.  Eli looked like a little puppy, not a wolf and certainly not a werewolf.

Jace and Eric stepped into the room and burst into laughter.  “Oh my goodness Trish, this is great, I can’t believe this worked out\!”  Eric walked over to Cameron and looked at him.  “He is like a little puppy boy now, I can’t wait to show the neighbourhood\!”

“Well I held up my end of the bargain, I’ll meet you at the party, I have to get ready myself.”  Trish then started packing up

Cameron looked at his brother.  “Ou icked us, et us oh”, Cameron couldn’t get a hang of speaking with the fangs he tried to say “You tricked us, let us go.”  He just got even more flustered.

“I’m not sure what you are trying to say, but you're welcome for getting you such an awesome doggy costume to match our theme\!” Eric was holding back a laugh.  

Trish had finished packing up.  “Okay boys I’m off to get ready for the party, I’ll meet you there.”  She waved goodbye to everyone.

Jace saw Trish out.

Eric then walked over to the closet.  “I see you two are shocked about your costumes, we figured this would be a great way to keep you out of trouble during the party and it’s pretty funny.”  He opened the closet door to reveal a full length mirror.  Both Cameron and Eli saw themselves for the first time since putting the costumes on and saw the fangs, facepaint, ears, tail, paws and now noticed the final touch Trish had added.  He was wearing a red dog collar with a tag that read “LUCKY” on it.  Eli had a blue dog collar that read “ACE”.  They looked like two cute puppies.

Eli got embarrassed and reached up to the zipper on the back.  “Aye ant et is iffer”  Cameron was pretty sure Eli tried to say was talking about the zipper.  Eli tried for a couple minutes to find the zipper but the oversized paws wouldn’t let him grab it, in fact it looked like he was a puppy scratching behind his ear.

Cameron decided to join Eli and searched for the zipper behind his neck. 

Cameron then heard two clicks and saw in the mirror that a leash had been attached to his and Eli's neck by Jace, the leash both linked to a double dog walking leash.

“Okay boys, let’s go trick or treating.”  He handed Cameron and Jace an empty Halloween bucket which the two could barely hold in their paws.  Jace then tugged on the leash as he walked and Cameron and Eli fell to the ground.

“Ey, ez aws are hard o alk in” Cameron tried to say “These paws are hard to walk in.”.  He and Eli got up and tried to slowly walk around.  They took larger than normal steps to avoid tripping over themselves.

Jace and Eric got to the door and checked they had everything they needed.  “Okay picture time before we go\!”  Jace pulled out his phone and took some pictures of the group and of Eli and Cameron.

Cameron was getting really embarrassed, he could hardly speak, walk and he was wearing a cute puppy costume instead of the fierce werewolf.  Eli also had a couple tears in his eyes.

“Now none of those puppy dog eyes, come on, it's a pretty funny prank and you have to admit the costumes look great\!” Eric said hopefully.

Cameron tried to protest and just said quietly “Is on air”, he was trying to say “It’s not fair”.  

Jace then lightly tugged on the leash and said “Let’s go, we only have a little bit before we should be at the party.”  Cameron and Eli complied and walked ahead of Jace.  Once they were on the street they were the center of attention, two big werewolves walking their cute little puppies.  Cameron felt really embarrassed and tried to hide his head in his paws.  
They made it to the first house and Eric rang the doorbell, an older lady opened it. “Oh what do we have here\!”  Eric nudged Cameron and Eli.

“Come on Lucky, what do we say\!” Eric demanded

Cameron got annoyed his brother called him by his dog name and shyly tried to say “Trick or Treat” but actually said “icth oh weeth”.

“Oh I’m sorry honey, what was that?” the lady asked.

Cameron tried to say a little clearer but only came out louder “Icth oh weeth\!”.  He was trying to spit out the fangs to speak clearer but they wouldn’t budge in his mouth.

“Okay, okay, here is your candy\! Some for Lucky and some for Ace and some for there were wolf friends.”  The lady grabbed some chocolates and placed them in their buckets.  Eric and Jace also took some and placed them in a bag.

“What do you say Ace\!” Jace demanded.

Eli looked at the ground and tried to say “Thank You.” but it came out as “ank ooh”.  He just looked at the ground.

“Have a good night, don’t stay out too late, puppies need their sleep.”

Jace pulled on the leash and Cameron and Eli followed, both embarrassed by the encounter.  The next hour was all the same, everyone complimenting their costumes and people saying what good boys they were.  They even have some other kids ask if they could pet them, which Eric and Jace agreed to.  Cameron and Eli looked at each other, at least they had someone to share the humiliation with.

Once Cameron and Eli’s buckets were full Jace started to head towards the party.

The fours boys reached a house with some music coming from it, it was decorated for Halloween and had spooky lights up.  Eric and Jace stopped and addressed Eli and Cameron.  “Okay so Trish has set up this place with a few others so you should have some people to play with.”  Jace and Eric knocked on the door.  The door opened with Trish standing there, she was wearing a fantastic looking vampire costume, long black dress with matching makeup.

“Well looks like you four made it”  She winked at the boys.  “I’ll take Lucky and Ace downstairs and you two mingle with the others.”  Trish took the leash and led them downstairs.

Cameron and Eli had no choice but to follow Trish down the stairs and into the basement, where they found a few girls about their age dressed in princess and fairy costumes playing some games.  “Okay girls I brought you two puppies fresh from trick or treating, here is their leash and have some fun.”  Trish handed one of the girls their leash and went back upstairs.

“Oooh we get to play with some puppies, what are your names” One girl in a fairy costume asked.

Cameron looked at his feet, for some reason it was much more embarrassing since she was his age.  “Mm ameronh” he mumbled through the fangs meaning to say “I’m Cameron”.

Eli then piped up “Aye I am Ewi” trying to say “Hi I’m Eli.”

The girls all laughed at the trouble they had speaking, the girl in the fairy costume smiled and said. “It looks like my sister got you two good, I can’t believe you fell for all her tricks.  Well we can’t understand what you said so we'll just call you Lucky and Ace.  I am Cindy and this is Carol”  The two boys looked at each other and got more embarrassed.

The girls made the two there puppies, they agreed that they shouldn’t be treated as anything else.  “You two can be walking on two feet, dogs walk on four legs.”  Cindy demanded and walked over to Cameron and Eli and gave them a shove.  The shove knocked them both to the ground since they didn’t have a lot of control over their feet.  “If I see you walking around I’m going to push you back down.”  Cameron and Eli then spent the rest of the night crawling on the ground and doing what the girls demanded.

After a few hours and well after their bed time Eric and Jace came down.  “Hey boys, we need to get home before mom and dad.”  Without waiting for a response he grabbed the leash and started heading out.  They heard from the basement, “Bye Lucky and Ace, I hope you had a Happy Halloween\!”

The group walked home and when they got inside Jace finally detached the leash from the collar.  “Okay Ace show Lucky where he is sleeping and I’ll see you in the morning.”  Eric and Jace then went upstairs and closed Jace’s bedroom door.

Eli could see the sleepiness in Cameron’s eyes and the two went to his room.  Once there they tried for some time to take the costumes off, they tried reaching for the zippers and trying to take each other’s costume off.  They quickly realized that with the costume paws they couldn’t pull down the zippers.  They tried to take off the collars as well but couldn’t manage it.

“Es oh oos aye oh ge em oh ommoro” Eli tries to say “Let’s take them off tomorrow”.  Cameron nodded then looked around.  Nothing was set up for him to sleep on, Eli motioned to the bed and the two slept together on the bed until morning.  The costume was comfortable enough to sleep in, he didn’t even need a blanket.

Eli and Cameron slept soundly on the bed and were woken up by Eric.  Eric was no longer wearing the Werewolf costume and was just wearing a pair of jeans and a sweater.  “Good morning Lucky, I see you two had a fun night yesterday, we should head home.”  Eric picked up Cameron’s clothes and tossed them in his backpack, he also grabbed Cameron’s candy bucket and carried it.  He grabbed his paw covered hand and the two left for home.

“Hey thanks for putting up with the costume yesterday, it was mostly Jace’s idea.”  

“Ick es embarrassing” Cameron tried to say “It is embarrassing”.

“Sorry, I know it’s embarrassing, still funny though.”  Once at home Cameron and Eric went to Cameron’s room and Cameron motioned for Eric to take off his costume.  Eric unzipped Cameron’s costume.  Cameron could finally move freely, he could easily walk and had full control over his hands.

Without thinking Cameron went to the washroom since he hasn’t gone since yesterday.  Once finished he looked in the mirror, his head was still painted to look like a puppy and he even still had the ears on.  He reached up and tried to take out the fangs, he pulled and pulled but they were stuck on his teeth, he could not take them out\!  Cameron then tried to remove the dog's nose and it had the same problem.  He even tried to take off the dog ears but they were caught in his hair in a tangled mess.  Cameron then tried washing his face but the facepaint wasn’t coming off.  “As ith es uh” Cameron said to himself, “What with this stuff.”

After about twenty minutes he gave up and returned to his room, he saw the costume still on the floor and headed to his closet instead.  He grabbed a pair of sweatpants and a T-Shirt and marched over to Eric's room.  Cameron opened the door and looked at his brother “Ie ont ome Ahf” he tried to say “It won’t come off”

Eric looked at his brother “Hey man you better wash up, remember we said to Mom and Dad we would still go to church today.”

Cameron was getting flustered and walked to his brother's whiteboard on his wall and scribbled “It won’t come off”.

Eric’s eyes widened and followed Cameron back to the washroom, he tried a few things and came to the same conclusion.  “I’ll call Jace and Trish.”

Eric spent some time on the phone while Cameron waited.  “Okay well I have some news, it looks like Trish used some special type of adhesive for your teeth and you weren’t meant to sleep with them on.  You will need to wait another day before they loosen up enough to take them out.  As far the makeup Trish left a makeup removal kit at Jace’s.”

Cameron was horrified, he would be stuck like this even longer.
